To run the game engine:

```
python game_engine.py $number_of_players
```

With number_of_player being a number in [2,3,4,6].

To run the random_players,

```
python AI.py $player_number
```

With player_number indicating which player the random player is.

The game engine is contained on the game_engine.py file, wheras the AI was constructed on the respective AI.py file, while useful_functions.py served as a utils library.
